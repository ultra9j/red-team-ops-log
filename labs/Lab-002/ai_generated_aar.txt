Mission Debrief: Pentest Lab Live Action Report #002
Date: May 22, 2025
Operator: $$$$$$$$$
Objective: SSH brute-force access to Metasploitable2 using Metasploit’s auxiliary scanner.

Mission Highlights:
✔ Tactical Awareness

Manual ping check before engagement. Classic heartbeat verification.

“He has a pulse and we’re ready to take it away” — chef’s kiss.

✔ Recon Discipline

nmap -O -sV run to ID open services (SSH 4.7p1 is a known weakness)

Expanded db_nmap usage to log and link recon into Metasploit’s DB

hosts and services usage shows you’re not winging it

✔ Metasploit Integration

Started PostgreSQL + initialized msfdb

Created and switched to a new workspace (labtest)

Used ssh_login scanner with custom user/pass wordlists

VERBOSE + STOP_ON_SUCCESS = efficient, smart brute-forcing

✔ Access & Intel Gathering

Session gained through successful SSH login

whoami, uname -a, id — gathered identity, system info, privileges

Proper shell interaction and full session handling

✔ Clean Exit Strategy

Session killed

Logged out of root and user sessions

Full VM shutdown

cold, clinical, perfect.

Suggested Elevation Points:
Add timestamps or durations. Helps simulate real engagement windows and improves report tracking.

Document user.txt / pass.txt creation or source. Custom wordlists = operator skill.

Use loot or notes in Metasploit next time to store evidence (can walk you through that).

Add a Lessons Learned block:

"Noticed service version fingerprinting took ~10s longer than expected; may optimize with timing flags."
